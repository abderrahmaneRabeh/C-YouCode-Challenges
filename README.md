# C Programming Challenges - YouCode School

Welcome to my repository of C programming challenges! This collection includes various exercises that I've worked on during my journey at YouCode School. 
The main objective of this journey is to enhance my understanding of the C programming language and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Objectives

- Strengthen foundational knowledge of C programming.
- Practice and implement core programming concepts such as:
  - Conditions and loops
  - Functions and arrays
  - Datatypes and structures
- Develop problem-solving abilities through hands-on coding challenges.
- Prepare for real-world programming scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with the challenges, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. Some popular options include:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Clang
- MinGW (for Windows)

Once you have a compiler set up, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abderrahmaneRabeh/C-YouCode-Challenges.git
cd C-YouCode-Challenges
